The challenge title was : Ancient

in the description there was a file given called `Challenge.png` but when i tried to open it , 
it showed not a valid png ,

![](../images/crypto0.png)

so i checked the Header of that png & its seemed corrupted
so i used a Tool called `PCRT` which fixes png header automatically.
